I have begun to use AngularJS a lot.\r\n\r\n### PerlModules.net\r\n[PerlModules.net](https://www.perlmodules.net/) is a site that lets Perl programmers create their own RSS feeds that track new versions in their favourite Perl modules.\r\n\r\n### KJabberd\r\n[KJabberd](https://github.com/akarelas/KJabberd) is a simple Jabber server (written in Perl), especially designed to be integrated with websites. It's under development, but functional already.\r\n\r\n### XML::MyXML\r\n[XML::MyXML](https://metacpan.org/module/XML::MyXML) is a very easy-to-use Perl module, for parsing and creating XML documents.\r\n\r\n### Favourite Perl Modules\r\n[Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/), [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo), [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent)\r\n\r\n### Favourite JavaScript Libraries\r\n[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/)\r\n\r\n### Bugs I've found and/or fixed\r\nHere's a [list of bugs](/bugs.html) in other projects that I've found and/or provided a fix for since 2013.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/akarelas) (akarelas)\r\n* [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/KARJALA) (KARJALA)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alex.karelas)\r\n* [LinkedIn](http://gr.linkedin.com/in/alexanderkarelas)\r\n* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+AlexanderKarelas)\r\n* [My blog](http://perllove.tumblr.com/)\r\n* Elsewhere (punter)","google":"UA-41840988-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
