There, I program in Perl, MySQL and sometimes a bit of HTML/JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### Personal projects\r\nIn my spare time, I like to work on my own projects. KJabberd, XML::MyXML and I have a couple more that have not been released yet. I use AngularJS a lot.\r\n\r\n### KJabberd\r\n[KJabberd](https://github.com/akarelas/KJabberd) is a simple Jabber server (written in Perl), especially designed to be integrated with websites. I hope to make it clusterable one day.\r\n\r\n### XML::MyXML\r\n[XML::MyXML](https://metacpan.org/module/XML::MyXML::II) is a nice and easy Perl module, for parsing and creating XML documents.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/akarelas) (akarelas)\r\n* [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/KARJALA) (KARJALA)\r\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alex.karelas)\r\n* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/117575306592987548035/about)\r\n* Elsewhere (punter)","google":"UA-41840988-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
